I am Chandan Angadi, a Computational Logic graduate from the Technical University of Dresden, Germany, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. My expertise spans Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Optimization techniques, with a focus on demand and financial forecasting solutions.

I currently work as a Solution Architect at Adidas, where I design and implement scalable end-to-end forecasting systems used globally. Before that, I held roles as a Data Science Intern at BMW and a Software Developer at Tieto.

My research interests include multi-objective optimization and reinforcement learning for real-world applications. During my Master's thesis, I developed hybrid optimization algorithms to improve production costs, collaborating with TU Dresden and BMW.  
As part of my work, I am currently focusing my research on LLM-based applications to assist the platform service team at Adidas, developing a POC project to enhance their efficiency. My projects reflect my passion for solving complex challenges and driving innovation across industries.
