I am Vaishakh Keshava, a recent graduate from the School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. My area of specialization is Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Information Retrieval. 

I currently work as a Machine Learning Engineer at Google, where my focus revolves around Natural Language Processing. Before this, I  worked as Machine Learning Engineer at JPMorgan Chase and Co. where I worked on NLP and LLMs. Prior to that I was a Senior Software Engineer at Intuit.

My area of research includes neural information retrieval and NLP. I worked with [Prof. Jamie Callan](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~callan/) on building contextualized document term representations using deep contextual language models that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of a neural information retrieval system. One of my recent works with [Prof. Graham Neubig](http://www.phontron.com/) involves building a multi-dimensional evaluation framework for evaluating NLG using the in-context learning ability of LLM.
